        "* **Anomaly detection**: The objective is to learn what \"normal\" data looks like, and then use that to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production line or a new trend in a time series.\n",

        "* **Density estimation**: This is the task of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. Density is commonly used for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also for data analysis and visualization."
